docker-uptime
======

A turnkey remote website monitoring application using Node.js, MongoDB, Twitter Bootstrap, Docker and Docker Composer.

The intention of docker-uptime is to be able to have a working website monitor on any Linux server that has Docker and Docker Composer with only two commands.

This implementation add on the original work of of Uptime (https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime) by Francois Zaninotto (https://github.com/fzaninotto) and f the enhancements of Uptime 2 (https://github.com/gunmetal313-nodejs/uptime2) by gunmetal313-nodejs (https://github.com/gunmetal313-nodejs).

The Docker container is based on Alpine Linux 3.4 in order to keep the size as small as possible (229mb).
